Welcome. I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Columbia University. My fields are health economics, applied microeconomics, and industrial organization. My interests include long-term care and physician behavior, and my research is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship program.

See a list of my [publications and working papers here](https://andrewolenski.github.io/research), and a copy of my [CV here](https://andrewolenski.github.io/files/AndrewOlenski_CV.pdf).
