Welcome. I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Columbia University. My fields are health economics, applied microeconomics, and industrial organization. My research interests include long-term care and physician behavior.

See a list of my [publications and working papers here](https://andrewolenski.github.io/research), and a copy of my [CV here](https://andrewolenski.github.io/cv).
